# NFT-Based Ticketing System

## Project Description

The NFT-Based Ticketing System is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that revolutionizes event ticketing by using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as digital tickets. Each ticket is represented as a unique ERC-721 token, providing verifiable ownership, preventing counterfeiting, and enabling transparent secondary market transactions.

This smart contract system allows event organizers to create events, sell tickets as NFTs, and manage ticket validation, while providing users with secure, transferable, and verifiable digital tickets that serve as proof of purchase and attendance.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to transform the traditional ticketing industry by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent, secure, and user-centric ticketing ecosystem. We aim to:

- **Eliminate Fraud**: Use blockchain's immutable nature to prevent ticket counterfeiting and fraud
- **Reduce Scalping**: Implement smart contract controls to manage ticket resales and prevent excessive markup
- **Enhance User Experience**: Provide users with permanent digital collectibles that serve as proof of attendance
- **Create New Revenue Streams**: Enable artists and event organizers to earn royalties from secondary sales
- **Build Trust**: Establish a transparent system where all ticket transactions are publicly verifiable
